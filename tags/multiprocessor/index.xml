Please be warned :)&#xA;Herb Sutter, atomic Weapons: The C++ Memory Model and Modern Hardware:&#xA;It’s a session that includes topics I’ve publicly said for years is Stuff You Shouldn’t Need To Know and I Just Won’t Teach, but it’s becoming achingly clear that people do need to know about it.</description>
